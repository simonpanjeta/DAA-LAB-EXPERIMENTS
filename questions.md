# LAB Experiments
-	Implement the activity selection problem to get a clear understanding of greedy approach.

-	Get a detailed insight of dynamic programming approach by the implementation of Matrix Chain Multiplication problem and see the impact of parenthesis positioning on time requirements for matrix multiplication.

-	Compare the performance of Dijkstra and Bellman ford algorithm for the single source shortest path problem.

-	Through 0/1 Knapsack problem, analyze the greedy and dynamic programming approach for the same dataset.

-	Implement the sum of subset and N Queen problem.

-	Compare the Backtracking and Branch & Bound Approach by the implementation of 0/1 Knapsack problem. Also compare the performance with dynamic programming approach.
